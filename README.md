🧩 Core Constraint: No-Import Rookie → only built-in functions, no libraries

🧮 Line Budget: Compact Coder → ≤ 150 lines

🎨 Project Domain: Visual Creation → ASCII art, charts, graphics

✅ And your ASCII_MIRROR project fits perfectly:

It’s purely p5.js (no external imports or APIs)

Under 150 lines (verified 148)

It’s a visual creation — real-time ASCII rendering from webcam/image

💡 Why This Project

ASCII_MIRROR was built to prove that creativity doesn’t need external libraries or endless lines of code. Within the 150-line limit and using only built-in functions, it turns your webcam feed or uploaded image into dynamic ASCII art — converting pixels into pure text visuals.

Visual Creation: Art and interactivity through characters and color.

Compact Coder: Clean logic within tight constraints.

No-Import Rookie: Pure code, pure creativity.

“We didn’t just mirror your face — we mirrored how code can be art.”
